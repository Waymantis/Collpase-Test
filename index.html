            <h5>Adobe After Effects</h5>
            <p>In order to make your video stand out from the crowd, the right tools need to be used in the right places. One such tool is After Effects. Through my knowledge of After Effects, I can composite images, tidy up imperfections, and add slick motion graphics to any project.</p>
            <h5>Adobe Audition</h5>
            <p>While having good visuals is one thing, bad audio can ruin the entire experience. With my knowledge of Adobe Audition and practiced knowledge of sound design, I ensure I strike a balance of strong a strong audio visual experience.</p>
